Used Django to create a web app. Designed a data model that represents the relationship between to-do items and lists. Explore the data model and add test data through the django admin interface. Displayed lists by coding templates. Handled the database operations through class-based views. Created URL Configurations to control the Django URL dispacher and route requests to the views.
